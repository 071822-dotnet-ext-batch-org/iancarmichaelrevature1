   Corrected a namespace error.

   Still trying to get the hang of these Getters and Setters,
   as well as dealing with OOP design principles.
   I need simple answers to stupid things like: 
   "Are my variables I've declared in this class being accessed 
   in my main method, or am I being redundant?"
   
   On the bright side, I feel like I'm just a few stupid 
   questions away from a serious 'Ah-hah!' Moment.
