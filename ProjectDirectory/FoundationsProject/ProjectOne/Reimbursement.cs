/* Still trying to get the hang of these Getters and Setters,
   as well as dealing with OOP design principles
   I need simple answers to stupid things like: 
   "Are my variables I've declared in this class being accessed in my main method, or am I being redundant?"
   
   On the bright side, I feel like I'm just a few stupid questions away from a serious 'Ah-hah!' Moment. */
